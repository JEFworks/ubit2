	  UBiT2 is an open-source, interactive, client-side web-application that enables fast, simple bioinformatics analysis online. No downloads, installations, registration, or accounts are needed. Your data never leaves your own computer. Current modules have been developed for use with Fluidigm BiomarkTM multiplex qRT-PCR gene expression data. Using just a browser, users can copy and paste in their data to perform standard analyses such as quality control, filtering, hierarchical clustering, principal component analysis, differential expression analysis, gene set enrichment testing, and more, all with interactive visualizations and exportable reports.
