	  We present a purely client-side web-application, UBiT2 (User-friendly BioInformatics Tools), that provides installation-free, offline alignment, analysis, and visualization of RNA-sequencing as well as qRT-PCR data. Analysis modules were designed with single cell transcriptomic analysis in mind. Using just a browser, users can perform standard analyses such as quality control, filtering, hierarchical clustering, principal component analysis, differential expression analysis, gene set enrichment testing, and more, all with interactive visualizations and exportable publication-quality figures.

	  We welcome any suggestions or enhancement requests through <a href="https://github.com/JEFworks/ubit2/issues">Github Issues</a>.
