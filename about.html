	  ubit2 is an experiment in the scalability of reproducible, on-demand, HIPAA-compliant, user-friendly bioinformatics.
	  <br><br>
	  Imagine you are reading a scientific paper. You see a figure. The figure is interactive. All the data and code used to generate that figure are accessible and downloadable. On-demand. At the same time as thousands of other readers. Without crashing the server.
	  <br><br>
	  Alternatively, you are a bench biologist. You sent your samples to a core facility and just received back a bunch of data. You want to assess the quality of your data and perform some simple, standard analytics before consulting a bioinformatician. But you don't know how to code. But you do know how to copy and paste your data into a simple web GUI. All analysis are performed in such a way that the server never sees, accesses, or stores any of your data, thus preserving data privacy. ubit2 aims to make this possible.
	  <br><br>
	  Our initial modules are designed with bioinformatics analyses for gene expression data in mind. Typically datasets involve matrices of quantified gene expression levels for multiple samples versus multiple genes. Common analyses include checking the distribution of the library size across samples, hierarchical clustering and heatmap visualization of gene expression, k-means classification, principal component analysis, and gene set enrichment testing. 
	  <br><br>
	  ubit2 is a work in progress. We welcome any suggestions or enhancement requests through <a href="https://github.com/JEFworks/ubit2/issues">Github Issues</a>.
